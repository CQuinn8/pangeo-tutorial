# Pangeo Tutorial

Welcome to the Pangeo Tutorial.
This is a live session from which you can run Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use Xarray, Dask and Jupyter.
Pangeo is a community effort and big-data platform for the geo and other sciences.
This collection of tutorials is intended to demonstrate some of the operations that can be performed using Pangeo.

A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.  There are overview notebooks about how to use dask, and a variety of scientific use cases.

Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  These will activate when you
run the cells in your Jupyter notebooks that create a Dask `Client` (these are already written for you).

To get started, go into the notebook folder on the left, double click on a notebook, like `dask.ipynb`, and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.

## Learn More

Links are available within each notebook for additional documentation on that topic.

## Where is this running?

This session is running on [binder.pangeo.io](http://binder.pangeo.io), a service designed by the Jupyter community, and operated by the Pangeo community with additional services like the ability to use [dask-kubernetes](https://kubernetes.dask.org/en/latest/). This Binder is running on Google Cloud Platform in the `us-central1-b` region.
